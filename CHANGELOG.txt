v9 (1st Early Beta)
===
-Added a recipe for the solar heater
-Tweaked solar heater logic, it should no longer go past ~400k on its own
-Apple sauce is now a food
-Stuff

v8
===
-Added a new block, the solar heater, passively generates a little heat during the day, but has a relatively low heat cap (~400K)
-Added simplistic tooltips for all of the machines
-Fixed Macerator crash when gear part breaks
-Fixed location of the froth flotation progress bar
-Added braggite to possible output for sulfide ore, so it's actually possible to get platinum now
-Stuff

v7
===
-Fixed server startup crash
-Added a lot of crushed/slurry items for existing minerals, and associated recipes

v6
===
-Added a bunch of miscellaneous machine recipes/re-arranged a bunch of recipes
-Added a recipe for platinum electrode
-Added a recipe for Froth Flotation Chamber
-Fixed recipe click area for the Froth Flotation Chamber
-Stuff

v5
===
-Added 10-15 new mineral items
-Added a new machine, the Froth Flotation Chamber (aka ore washing), still needs some polishing
-Added miscellaneous machine recipes
-Stuff

v3
===
-Reduced ore world gen rates some more
-Some new ore textures
-Sulfur ore will now drop XP
-Increased the hardness of ores
-Doubled the base yield of most ores in the macerator from 4 to 8 mineral chunks
-Implemented the 'efficiency' stat for the macerator gears. It is now an output multiplier for any recipe
 that uses efficiency, currently this only applies to ores
-Now, whenever a gear is removed from the macerator progress instantly resets so that you can't cheese it
 with a high-speed, low efficiency gear, then switch to a high-efficiency gear at the last second
-Looking for gear usages in JEI now shows which macerator recipes that gear can use considering its tier
-The logic for reaction chamber item insertion is now a little smarter

v2
===
-Added (VERY) primitive textures so that all blocks are distinguishable
-Decreased world gen chance for all of the ores
-Added recipes for the electrolyzer & reaction chamber
-Minerals with chemical formulas in the tooltip should no longer have unnecessary parentheses around them
-Added 2 items: Sal Ammoniac & Natron
-Added ~10-15 new machine recipes
-Stuff
