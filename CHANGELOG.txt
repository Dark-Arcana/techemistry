v3

-Reduced ore world gen rates some more
-Some new ore textures
-Sulfur ore will now drop XP
-Increased the hardness of ores
-Doubled the base yield of most ores in the macerator from 4 to 8 mineral chunks
-Implemented the 'efficiency' stat for the macerator gears. It is now an output multiplier for any recipe
 that uses efficiency, currently this only applies to ores
-Now, whenever a gear is removed from the macerator progress instantly resets so that you can't cheese it
 with a high-speed, low efficiency gear, then switch to a high-efficiency gear at the last second
-Looking for gear usages in JEI now shows which macerator recipes that gear can use considering its tier
-The logic for reaction chamber item insertion is now a little smarter
